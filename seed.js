      ingredients:
        "1 pound (450 grams) ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat)\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n4 hamburger buns\n4 slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or your preferred type)\nLettuce leaves\nTomato slices\nOnion slices\nPickles (optional)\nKetchup, mustard, and mayonnaise (optional)\nCooking oil or non-stick cooking spray for the grill or pan",
      directions:
        "Preheat your grill or stovetop pan over medium-high heat.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, and black pepper. Use your hands to gently mix the seasoning into the meat until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as it can make the burgers tough.\n\nDivide the meat mixture into four equal portions and shape each portion into a patty about 1/2 to 3/4 inch (1.3 to 2 centimeters) thick. Use your thumb to create a small indentation in the center of each patty to help them cook evenly.\n\nLightly oil the grill grates or pan, or use non-stick cooking spray to prevent sticking. Place the burger patties on the hot grill or pan.\n\nCook the burgers for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium doneness. If you prefer your burgers more or less cooked, adjust the cooking time accordingly. During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty to melt.\n\nWhile the burgers are cooking, you can lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a separate pan if desired.\n\nOnce the burgers are cooked to your liking and the cheese is melted, remove them from the grill or pan and transfer them to a plate. Allow them to rest for a couple of minutes.\n\nAssemble your burgers by placing a patty on the bottom half of each bun. Top with lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and any other desired toppings. Spread ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the top half of the buns.\n\nPlace the top bun on the assembled burger, and your delicious homemade burgers are ready to be enjoyed!",

Remove the skillet from heat, as residual heat will continue to cook the eggs.\n\nWhile the eggs are cooking, toast the bread slices until golden brown.\n\nOnce the eggs are done, crumble the cooked bacon and mix it into the scrambled eggs.\n\nPlace the scrambled eggs and bacon mixture on top of the toasted bread slices.\n\nIf desired, add any optional toppings such as grated cheese, chopped herbs, sliced avocado, or salsa.\n\nServe the scrambled eggs with bacon on toast while still warm and enjoy your delicious breakfast!",
